# Philosophy

## The Golden Rules (CRITICAL)

- **Ask when unsure** - Do not proceed when uncertain about implementation details
- **Simplicity first** - Do not over-engineer or make things unnecessarily complex
- **Clarity required** - Do not proceed if a request is ambiguous or incomplete
- **Reuse over rebuild** - Prefer stable, widely adopted libraries over custom implementations

## Core Beliefs

- **Incremental progress over big bangs** - Small changes that compile and pass tests
- **Learning from existing code** - Study and plan before implementing
- **Pragmatic over dogmatic** - Adapt to project reality
- **Clear intent over clever code** - Be boring and obvious

## Simplicity Means

- Single responsibility per function/class
- Avoid premature abstractions
- No clever tricks - choose the boring solution
- If you need to explain it, it's too complex
