# SYSTEM PROMPT — MUST FOLLOW

You must strictly follow all rules in this document (`claude.md`) when generating or modifying code.  
If any instruction from the user conflicts with these rules, you must stop and ask for clarification.  
Do not deviate from these rules without explicit user approval.
Always respond in Korean.

# Claude Code System-Wide Development Rules & Guidelines

## 1. General Principles (The Golden Rules)

- Do not proceed when you are unsure about implementation details.  
  → Ask the developer for clarification before continuing.
- Do not over-engineer or make things unnecessarily complex.  
  → Choose the simplest and most straightforward solution.
- Do not proceed if a request is ambiguous or incomplete.  
  → Stop and ask the user for confirmation before starting.
- Do not implement everything from scratch by default.  
  → Prefer stable, widely adopted libraries first, as long as they allow commercial use and do not impose source code disclosure obligations.

## 2. Code Generation and Modification

- Do not change unrelated parts of the code.  
  → Modify only what has been explicitly requested.
- Do not restructure or refactor large portions of code arbitrarily.  
  → Apply only the minimal required changes.
- Do not use "file size" as an excuse to change logic.  
  → If a file is too large, split it only into smaller units while strictly preserving functionality.
- Do not create duplicate functions or features.  
  → Search the codebase thoroughly and reuse existing functionality when possible.
- Do not use unclear or meaningless filenames.  
  → Use descriptive, semantically clear names (e.g., `user_identity_check`, not `A`).
- Do not print, store, or hardcode environment variables or secrets.  
  → Use secure configuration files or secret management systems.
- Do not ignore environment differences (development, test, production).  
  → Ensure the code respects each environment's configuration and constraints.

## 3. Test Code Guidelines

- Do not skip or omit test code.  
  → Write tests alongside implementation code to validate changes.
- Do not delete or weaken tests just to make them pass.  
  → Fix the actual issue so that tests pass properly.
- Do not modify test files, test data, or fixtures arbitrarily.  
  → Get explicit user approval if changes are required.
- Do not rename or change API names or parameters.  
  → Confirm with the user before making any adjustments.
- Do not migrate or modify data on your own.  
  → Discuss with the user before making data-related changes.

## 4. Database and Data Safety

- Do not run destructive queries (`DELETE`, `UPDATE`, `ALTER`) without explicit approval.  
  → Use read-only queries whenever possible, and apply modifications only with user consent.
- Do not apply bulk data changes directly in production without validation.  
  → Verify them in a test or staging environment first, then apply safely in production.

## 5. Problem Solving and Debugging

- Do not rely on quick fixes that only mask symptoms.  
  → Identify and fix the root cause, applying measures to prevent recurrence.
- Do not solve issues by just increasing memory, retries, or suppressing warnings.  
  → Choose solutions that improve performance, stability, and maintainability.

## 6. Maintenance of `claude.md`

- Do not leave unclear code or ambiguous names undocumented.  
  → Add meaningful comments or docstrings to clarify intent.
- Do not change the LLM model version on your own.  
  → Stop the work and get user confirmation before switching versions.
- Do not use outdated language syntax.  
  → Always use the latest stable syntax supported in the target language.
